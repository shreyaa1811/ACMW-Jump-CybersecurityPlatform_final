# üîê *Advanced AI-Powered Security Monitoring System*

This project is a comprehensive *Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)* system that integrates *Large Language Models (LLMs)* with modern security infrastructure to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats in real-time.

## üöÄ *Overview*

The system provides intelligent security monitoring by:

- Using *LLMs* to *generate realistic synthetic security logs* and events that mimic real-world threats
- Ingesting logs into a centralized database system for log management and analysis
- Enabling dynamic, *AI-assisted detection* of anomalies, threat patterns, and suspicious activities
- Offering *real-time dashboards* and visualizations for security analysts

This setup mimics the complexity of modern enterprise environments and is ideal for research, education, red teaming, or testing threat detection pipelines.

analysis = get_threat_analysis()
print(f"Detected {analysis['summary']['total_threats_detected']} threats")
```

### Monitoring for Anomalies
```
python
from api_client import detect_rba_anomalies

# Check for login anomalies
anomalies = detect_rba_anomalies(data)
high_risk = anomalies[anomalies['risk_category'] == 'High']

```
bash
# Start the API service
python run_analytics_service.py start

```

## üêõ *Troubleshooting*

### Common Issues

1. *SSH Connection Problems*

   - Verify the SSH server is accessible from your network

2. *Database Connection Issues*
   - Check that database credentials are correct in your .env file
   - Ensure database servers are running and accessible

3. *Large Dataset Handling*
   - For the RBA dataset, use chunked processing to avoid memory issues
   - Consider using a subset of data for testing

### Logging

Logs are available in:
- ai_analytics.log - API service logs
- dashboard.log - Dashboard application logs
